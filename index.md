## Welcome to Neurobagel

The goal of Neurobagel is to make describing and finding neuroimaging data easy.
Searching across data that live on distributed storage systems is tricky, 
and the technologies that make it possible are not usually something
researchers have experience with, or time to learn.

We build web-based, graphical user interfaces that make these steps easier:

- [annotate and harmonize demographic data](https://github.com/neurobagel/annotation_tool)
- [define and find subject level cohort across neuroimaging datasets](https://github.com/neurobagel/concept_query)

These tools are still in early development but we are excited to 
share them with the neuroimaging community and are always looking
for feedback.

Take a look at [our neurobagel github repositories](https://github.com/neurobagel) and 
[our roadmap](https://github.com/neurobagel/.github/blob/main/profile/roadmap.md) to 
get a sense of what we are doing at the moment!
